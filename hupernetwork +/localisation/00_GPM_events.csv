EVTNAME50006;Hokkaido Island Treaty;x;
EVTDESC50006;After our complete unification, we can expand our national territory by signing an agreement in which we will obtain Hokkaido Island and incorporate it into our country, as well as gain the provinces as cores. This will increase tensions with the Russian Empire and could lead to war in the future.;x;
EVTOPTA50006;Annex the Island!;x;
EVTOPTB50006;We refuse the island;x;
EVTNAME50007;The St. Petersburg Treaty;x;

EVTOPTB50007;Don't accept the treaty;x;
EVTNAME50100;Sakhalin and Kuril Islands Question;x;
EVTDESC50100;Sakhalin Island is without a stable governor so by resorting to democracy, we must establish a protectorate on the islands and establish a stable government, we have information that the Japanese have tried to do the same as well;x;

EVTNAME50200;The Oriental Crisis;x;
EVTDESC50200;In the preceding decades, Muhammad Ali had expanded and strengthened his hold on Ottoman territory, beginning with Egypt where he acted as a viceroy for the Sultan. Called upon to assist the Ottomans in the Greek War of Independence, Muhammad Ali in return demanded parts of Ottoman Syria to be transferred to his personal rule. When the war ended and the Porte failed to keep its promise, Muhammad Ali launched a military campaign against his Ottoman masters and easily took most of the Syrian lands.;x;
EVTOPTA50200;Raise the Egyptian flags!;x;
EVTNAME50201;Egypt Proclaims it's independence;x;
EVTDESC50201;Mohamed Ali has done his thing in Egypt and now he is about to proclaim his independence over us, this is due to the tolerance of our government in Egypt, allowing decisions to be made that a vassal like Egypt should not take alone, that is why we must restore the order in all provinces that were once Ottoman.;x;
EVTOPTA50201;We must restore order in Egypt;x;
EVTOPTB50201;Negotiate with them;x;
EVTNAME50202;The Ottoman Empire accepts our demands;x;
EVTDESC50202;After a long wait, we can finally proclaim our independence, of course, relative, since the Ottomans demand us to return the Middle Eastern territories to them... We can also reject their proposals, but we will risk losing a certain war with them;x;
EVTOPTA50202;Accept their demands;x;
EVTOPTB50202;Reject their demands;x;
EVTNAME50203;Egypt Refuses our demands!;x;
EVTDESC50203;The Egyptians have rejected our generous peace offer, this cannot be allowed and must be condemned. Egypt has only a few days of independence left and will soon return to being a vassal of our mighty and prosperous nation. Long live the Ottoman Empire;x;
EVTOPTA50203;Long live to the Ottoman Empire!;x;
EVTNAME50204;Egypt Surrenders!;x;
EVTDESC50204;In 1839, the Ottoman Empire attempted to retake Syria from Muhammad Ali but was defeated by his son, Ibrahim Pasha in the Battle of Nezib. Thus, a new war between Muhammad Ali and the Ottomans escalated, with the latter failing once again to wage it successfully. In June 1840, the entire Ottoman navy defected to Muhammad Ali, and the French planned to offer full support to his cause.;x;
EVTOPTA50204;A good day for our nation;x;
EVTOPTB50204;We need entire Egypt;x;

EVTNAME50300;The $CAPITAL$ Conference of $YEAR$;x;
EVTDESC50300;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. The outcome has become known as the 'General Act of the $CAPITAL$ Conference', formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;x;
EVTOPTA50300;We must Colonize all of Africa;x;
EVTNAME50400;The Hungarian Revolt;x;
EVTDESC50400;A war rages in the Austrian Empire as Hungary attempt to secede from the Union. The outcome is uncertain, but already this promises to be a new type of war as both sides have access to railroads, telegraphs, and repeating rifles. Meanwhile, Great Britain is experimenting with the first iron-hulled steam-driven warship, a combination which promises to revolutionise the war at sea. World wide the industrial revolution is gathering speed as more and more nations start to industrialise. The times they are changing for our nation.;x;

EVTNAME50206;The Balkan Rebellion;x;
BALKANWARSDESC;The Balkan area has always been a challenge for us to maintain armed peace, it seems that the countries that managed to gain full independence from us have defrauded us and demanded that we give up our Balkan territories and thus avoid a war, we are willing to have Turkish territories taken from us?;x;
EVTOPTA50206;The balkans are ours!;x;

EVTNAME50102;The Crimean Incident;x;

EVTOPTA50103;Fine!;x;
CRIMEANWARDESC;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests. We can support the russians and end our political influence in the ottomans or we can support the ottomans and secure our trades of oil and tea;x;

EVTNAME50104;Sweeden Demands Finland;x;

EVTDESC50407;This territorial and social unification could lead to greater stability in the national territory in addition to ensuring an important position in Austrian politics and the option of being able to carry out our own reforms in our sub-state territory.;x;
EVTOPTA50407;Let's Do It!;x;
EVTOPTB50407;We can't do this;x;
EVTNAME50408;They Accept!;x;
EVTOPTA50408;Long Live to the New Federation!;x;
EVTNAME50409;They Reject!;x;
EVTOPTA50409;Oh no...;x;
EVTNAME51102;The Gold Rush;x;
EVTDESC51102;The recent arrivals of immigrants in our country have caused an increase in the search for the long-awaited American gold, recent reports of these searches affirm that they have found gold, a lot of gold, as much gold as for the offer to the US general staff. We must finance these long-awaited expeditions if we do not want to miss the opportunity.;x;
EVTOPTA51102;For the Gold!;x;
EVTNAME51605;The Warlord Era;x;
EVTDESC51605;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their independence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;x;
EVTOPTA51605;The Chinese will be united again!;x;
EVTNAME51604;The Chinese Restoration;x;
EVTDESC51604;The Chinese nation has always been divided between breakaway dynasties and other kingdoms. Now that we have become civilized, we can unify all the territory where there are Chinese people and create a pleasant atmosphere in a new and neutral nation called "China", which will be ruled by the rising Qing dynasty, but now with a more democratic and faithful system for the Europeans...;x;
EVTNAME51606;The Xinhai Revolution;x;
EVTDESC51606;The constant threats against us in xinhai have led the separatists to declare an independent state which will worsen the stability of the country. Anyway, the rebellion won't last long, let's hope...;x;
EVTNAME5607;The New Chinese Army;x;
EVTDESC51607;For a long time, the Chinese have been one of the countries with an army superior to our enemies, but in the absence of modernization, we have lost many wars that, with the recent modernization of other countries, would be even worse wars. That is why we have devised a modernization of the Chinese army...;x;
EVTOPTA51606;Not Today!;x;
EVTOPTB51606;Democracy?;x;
EVTOPTA51607;Oh no...;x;
EVTNAME51608;The Breakup of China;x;
EVTDESC51608;The Chinese empire is now a dream;x;
EVTOPTA51608;For the empire!;x;
EVTNAME51609;The New Chinese Empire;x;
EVTDESC51609;Today is a memorable day as we have finished unifying the Chinese Empire again. Those affected are the people who have not survived and cannot see this magnificent unification, in any case, the current situation in our country gives much to be desired and we must do something to solve it...;x;
EVTOPTA51609;Long Live China;x;
EVTNAME51701;The Fall of France;x;
EVTDESC51701;Since we started the war of German unification, France has always been against us until today. The memorable day when Paris fell and forced the infamous French to surrender right down to our feet... Three cheers for Germany!;x;
EVTOPTA51701;Annex "Elsass-Lothringen";x;
EVTOPTB51701;Continue the war!;x;
EVTNAME51610;Rebels in Tibet!;x;
EVTDESC51610;The unification efforts for our nation have only provoked incidents and internal rebellions in our country like this problem in the troubled region of Tibet. Is it still our duty to unify all of China, or should we switch sides?;x;
EVTOPTA51610;This can't be accepted!;x;
EVTOPTB51610;The dream is now dead;x;
EVTNAME50509;The English Imperialism;x;
EVTDESC50509;The constant English pressures on our territory are unable to withstand for our bureaucracy. Now that our country is weaker than ever, the British are trying to create a less independent state in the Canadian region. Should we cede positions to them?;x;
EVTOPTA50509;We can't do anything against them;x;
EVTOPTB50509;Reject the offer!;x;
EVTNAME50902;The Papal-Italian Restoration;x;
EVTDESC50902;After the unification of most of the Italian states on the peninsula, the Italians focus on a small state in the heart of the country: The Papal States, the incredible efforts on the part of Italy to annex this country without success are too many to count. That they leave behind the mission of unifying. Tired of our presence, the Italians press against us once more, but this time with more force.;x;
EVTOPTA50902;Make a treaty!;x;
EVTOPTB50902;Then... Is war;x;
EVTNAME50903;The Treaty of Rome;x;
EVTDESC50903;Thanks to our dedication, the French have relented and have allowed us to annex the papal states and from now on we will host the pope in Rome (Italy). At last there will be no French influence on Italian territory...;x;
EVTOPTA50903;Glory to Italy!;x;
EVTNAME50306;The Scramble for Africa;x;
EVTDESC50306;The colonial powers of the world have gathered in a european capital to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;x;
EVTOPTA50306;We are interesed in the act;x;
EVTOPTB50306;We have better things to do;x;
EVTNAME50305;The Egyptian Protectorate;x;
EVTDESC50305;The Conference in which the great European empires divided up the territories, touches us on the great and precious Egyptian territory, so we must annex it as soon as possible before another great European power.;x;

EVTOPTB50305;We don't want more protectorates;x;
EVTNAME50307;The Ethiopian Protectorate;x;
EVTDESC50307;The Conference in which the great European empires divided up the territories, touches us on the great and precious Ethiopian territory, so we must annex it as soon as possible before another great European power.;x;
EVTOPTA50307;We want entire Ethiopia!;x;
EVTNAME50904;Napoleon's III Coup;x;
EVTDESC50904;In the year 1769, the imperialist Napoleon Bonaparte took over the country in a coup and then caused a full-scale war across Europe, the biggest war to date. Now his successor, Napoleon III, seeks to seize power and restore the glory of the French Empire.;x;
EVTOPTA50904;Welcome to the new French Empire;x;
EVTOPTB50904;Expel that "human" to an Island!;x;
EVTNAME50111;The Russian Civil War;x;
EVTDESC50111;The militancy of our country is too high for our territory to remain united under a single command. Recently we have received notices of communist revolts in several central areas of the Russian Empire, we must act as soon as possible.;x;
EVTOPTA50111;We cannot allow any communist in Russia!;x;
EVTOPTB50111;The communism is the future of Russia!;x;
EVTNAME50510;Typewriter Invention;x;
EVTDESC50510;The first typewriter has been finished at last, the fate of our nation has been decided with this great breakthrough of technology thanks to our inventors who have carried out this invention. It has been created by the inventor Christopher Sholes, who today gave a lecture at the center of $CAPITAL$;X;
EVTNAME51201;San Marco Integration;x;

EVTNAME50511;The Irish Rebellion;x;
EVTOPTA50511;Oh no...;x;
EVTOPTB50511;Long live Ireland!;x;
EVTNAME51703;Austria accepts!;x;
EVTDESC51703;A long time ago we began to dispute the German nation with our neighbor Austria, which until 100 years ago led the nation in the form of an empire with small semi-independent autonomies. After the defeat of Napoleon, we prevailed against Austria to unify the German Empire and despite our differences, we have managed to reach an agreement and now they want to belong to our nation.;x;
EVTOPTA51703;Annex all Austria!;x;
EVTOPTB51703;Annex only german territories;x;
EVTOPTC51703;We only want Austria and Slovenia;x;
EVTNAME50512;The Origin of The Species by Darwin;x;
EVTDESC50512;The famous philosopher Charles Darwin has recently published through our influence his so-called book "The Origin of Species" in which he tells how, according to evolutionary theory, all the species we know today evolved, from mice to savannah elephants.;x;
EVTNAME51005;The Brazilian Pressure;x;
EVTDESC51005;The nation of Brazil has always had great ambitions to occupy most of the Amazonas in the name of their emperor. We still have a part of this great forest left, so we do not have any option of resistance. We need to decide, war or diplomacy;x;
EVTOPTA51005;Accept the treaty;x;
EVTOPTB51005;Then is war!;x;
EVTNAME51201;San Marino Petitions for Annexation;x;
EVTDESC51201;The constant ideas of Italian unification have brought the independence of the Republic of San Marco, so we must unify all the territories of Italy under our direct rule.;x;
EVTNAME50210;The Balkan Countries Surrender;x;
EVTOPTA50210;Our moment has come;x;
EVTOPTB50210;Not today, restore the stability in the Balkans;x;
EVTOPTB51003;Reject the purposal!;x;
EVTOPTA50302;Fine;x;
EVTNAME51702;The German Purposal;x;
EVTDESC51702;The Germans do not propose a joint agreement between all the belligerent countries of the German Confederation. The treaty consists of signing an annexation agreement to the new nation of Germany, our advisers propose us to accept to avoid territorial conflicts in the future, but the decision is ours.;x;
EVTNAME51704;Austria rejects!;x;
EVTDESC51704;The Austrians have taken our treaty as an offense against their independence. We should not have trusted these "Germans" who do not want unity and strength, the number of German people living in Austria is enough to claim cores in their territory, if they do not go with us, they go against us...;x;
EVTOPTA51704;Claim the German Cores;x;
EVTOPTB51704;We can't intervenue now;x;
EVTOPTA51702;Accept the treaty;x;
EVTOPTB51702;Reject the treaty;x;
EVTOPTA51201;Accept the Annexation;x;
EVTNAME51705;The Schleswig Rebellion;x;
EVTDESC51705;The recent tensions over our territory have given a lot to talk about for the powers of the world, especially Prussia, which has managed to get a large part of the population of Holstein to be in favor of a rebellion against the Danes... Against us, is the nation of Schleswig, which together with Denmark, will fight against us to resolve the long-awaited question about the Holstein region.;x;
EVTOPTA51705;For Germany!;x;
EVTOPTB51705;For Denmark!;x;
EVTNAME51706;The Holstein Question Solved;x;
EVTDESC51706;After decades of assimilation, the population of Holstein has decided after a civil war that they want to be part of the German confederation, which includes that we add it to the list of countries to be sphered to achieve the long-awaited Germany...;x;
EVTOPTA51706;Long live Germany!;x;
EVTNAME50513;The Indonesian Question;x;
EVTDESC50513;The beginning of colonization by other powers in other parts of the world has allowed us to think about the possibility of intervening in the Indonesian area, therefore, we must decide what to do with our colonial affairs...;x;
EVTOPTA50513;Demand territory!;x;
EVTOPTB50513;We have other plans;x;
EVTNAME50212;The Egyptian Liberation;x;
EVTDESC50212;The constant pressures on Cairo for being an Ottoman vassal have led us to think why we should continue being their puppets if we can declare our independence... The Ottomans are no longer what they were before and we can stop depending on them. Glory to Egypt!;x;
EVTOPTA50212;Glory to Egypt!;x;
EVTNAME50213;Rebellion in Egypt;x;
EVTDESC50213;The constant pressure on Cairo for being our vassal has led them to think about why they should continue being our puppets if they can declare their independence... The Egyptians are no longer what they were before and it seems that now they set the conditions without needing us.;x;
EVTOPTA50213;Declare war on Egipt!;x;
